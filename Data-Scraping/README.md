Data-Scraping a HTML file with Python

In this small project I took an HTML file (I don't own anything written in the HTML file) and scraped data from it. I scraped a table, created a dataframe for it with the pandas library, and saved it in a .csv file (TabelaSaPodacima.csv). I also scraped basic information about the product, the name, the description of the product, category and URL of the picture used for the product. I saved this information in a .txt file (Opisi.txt).

The purpose of this small project was to learn the basics of data scraping with Python!
