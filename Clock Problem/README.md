# Clock Problem
The problem reads as follow:

Given four digits, count how many valid times can be displayed on a digital clock (in 24-hour format) using those digits. The earliest time is 00:00 and the latest time is 23:59. Write a function:
		function(A, B, C, D)
that, given four integers A, B, C, and D (describing the four digis), returns the number of valid times that can be displayed on a digital clock. A, B, C, D are integers in the range of [0, ... ,9].

Example:
	* Given A=1, B=8, C = 3, D = 2, the function should return 6. The valid times are: 12:38. 13:28, 18:23, 18:32, 21:38 and 23:18
